= creating an asPath rule

The `asPath` file rule expects a javascript function that returns a Json object.

```yaml
name: example
path: test.txt
nest: foo
asPath: (path)=>({filePath:path})
```
The javascript function will receive the full path to the file
and the returned json will be merged with other file rules under the `nest` key.
```javascript
{
    foo: {
        filePath: "/tmp/run/output/test.txt"
    }
}
```

== When to use
parse is designed for text based files but `asPath` can be used to work with non-text files such as jfrs or coredumps.
The javascript function has 1 argument (the path) but can access the link:./javascript.adoc[javascript context].

```yaml
name: flight_recorder
path: *.jfr
nest: jfr
asPath: |
  (path)=>{
    const size = FileUtility.getInputSize(path)
    return { path,size}
  }
```
