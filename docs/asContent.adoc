= creating an asContent rule

The simplest file rule creates a json object with the file content under a key (`content` by default).

```yaml
name: example
path: test.txt
nest: foo
asContent: key #default value is 'content'
```

The above example will load `test.txt` into a json object

```javascript
{
  key: "<file_text>"
}
```

then merge it with the json from other file rules under the `foo` key

```javascript
{
    foo : {
        key: "<file_text>"
    }
    //other rule json...
}
```

The `asContent` file rule is similar to using a `.*` expression in `asText`
except that `asContent` preserves newlines and keeps the content as a single string.

=== When to use
The most common use case is when a file contains a version or identifier.
```bash
java -version > /tmp/java.version.txt
uname -r > /tmp/uname.txt
```
